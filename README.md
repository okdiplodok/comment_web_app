<b> Drozhki (Дрожки) </b> - is a web application aimed at making texts of XIX-century Russian novels more comprehensible for a present-day reader. Click on the option "Upload text" and insert a literary fragment into the window. The module determins words which can be difficult to understand for a reader and matches them with their definitions from Small Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language. The definition can be seen when clicking on the word. Some short definitions are also accompanied by hovering tooltips. Since the scope of this module is the Russian literature, inserted texts should also be written in Russian.
